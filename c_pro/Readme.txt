This is my version of the TV Series Who Wants To Be A MIllionaire.
The only differences are:

1. No poll the audience in this version
2. What ever you type in is your final answer when you press enter.
   It will not ask you if it's your final answer so be sure before
   you press enter!

A few other notes:

You can only use Phone A Friend and 50/50 once even though it will
come up with that option again.  If you try to use it more than once
it will tell you that it has already been used and repeat the question.

You cannot use Phone A Friend and 50/50 on the same question.  The good 
news is the questions are somewhat easier than the real game.

Just like the real game, when you reach a milestone question, you cannot
go below that amount in what you lose, BUT chosing to Walk Away will result
in losing everything down to the nearest Miles Stone Question instead of 
letting you keep that amount.  I made it this way because most of the questions
are so easy.

Be careful NOT to type in the answer, only the NUMBER OF THE ANSWER!

Also, when typing in your name, type in first name only -- no spaces.

You may redistribute this as long as it remains intact as a whole.

Now, lets play WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?!!? :)
